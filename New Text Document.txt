You could define a [user-define variable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbatch#user-defined-variables) and use it here.
To add the variable like $System.PullRequest.TargetBranchName, we recommend that you could submit a suggestion ticket to suggest the feature on: https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/report?space=21&entry=suggestion. That will allow you to directly interact with the appropriate product group, and makes it more convenient for the product group to collect and categorize your suggestions.
We highly appreciate your contribution in making our product better.

Since this API can only be used to get the user's owne profile information, you cannot fetch other user's profile via profile id and I didn't find relevant method to do this. If you need to get other users' profile id, we recommend that you could let the user run the api and find it in the response body.

Sorry for the late reply.
Please check the steps below and let me know how it goes:
